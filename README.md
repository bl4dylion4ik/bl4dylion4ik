### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a dedicated ML/Data Engineer with a proven track record of over 2 years, specializing in creating impactful products through the application of cutting-edge machine learning technologies. Throughout my journey, I have successfully contributed to diverse projects, showcasing my expertise in building robust data pipelines as well as delving into advanced areas such as Text-to-Speech and audio processing.

As an advocate of continuous learning, I am committed to staying current with the ever-evolving landscape of ML and data engineering. This mindset empowers me to embrace new challenges and implement novel techniques to drive project success. Beyond technical proficiency, I possess effective communication skills that facilitate seamless collaboration with cross-functional teams and stakeholders, ensuring that projects meet both technical and strategic objectives.

I'm passionate about NLP and audio processing tasks for the Belarusian language, like ASR, TTS, sentiment analysis, and language generation models.
